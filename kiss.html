Every day I think about you and those moments we long to spend together, and I feel like my heart is about to burst from all the love inside me. Imagine if we got even closer, and I gave you a sweet kiss that expresses everything I feel. It’s not just a kiss — it’s a promise that I’ll always be by your side, and that our life together will be filled with happiness. Are you ready to take this step with me? I’m sure it will be the most beautiful moment of our lives. I love you, my moon.

My dear beloved, light of my eyes, secret of my happiness,

I know your little heart is a bit scared right now, and that only makes me love you more, because it shows how sensitive and beautiful you are on the inside. But I’m here, my soul, to hold your hand and reassure you that everything will be exactly like the dream we’re dreaming together. I don’t just love you — I live for you. I won’t let this fear steal even a single moment of our happiness. If you feel any anxiety, I’ll be your shield, and we’ll step back without hesitation. The trust we’ve built together is stronger than any fear, my moon. And remember, this fear is completely normal in the beginning, just like any new adventure. But once we overcome it, we discover a much greater happiness — the kind people before us lived and later regretted missing. So many couples we know, or whose real stories we’ve seen, started their relationships with exactly this kind of courage, and it made them happier and closer than ever. That proof is all around us: people who truly love take these steps to build even stronger bonds.

Life is only once, and we can never get back what’s passed. So why miss the chance to live it in all its beauty? Opportunities like this don’t come every day. If we let it slip away, we’ll regret it later when we think about what could have been. Think about the moments we’ve already shared — even though they’ve been few, that feeling that pulls us closer every time isn’t a coincidence. It’s a sign that we’re ready for the next step. One kiss — just one — will be like a spark that lights up the whole world. It will carry all the tenderness I have for you and the longing that fills my heart every night when I think about your enchanting eyes. It’s not just a kiss, my honey. It’s a promise that I’ll always be your support, and that our life will become a legendary love story full of memories that make us smile every time we remember them. Remember the nights we spent talking about our dreams and sharing laughter? That’s only the beginning, and it’s what will make us stronger and happier. You know, my moon, that people who love deeply build memories like these to strengthen their bond — and that’s exactly what will happen with us. It will bring us even closer, just like the couples we secretly envy.

To make this moment even more perfect, let’s meet in a place that fits our secret love. Thursday morning at 7 o’clock, the university will be completely empty — like a quiet painting that has been waiting just for us. No one will be around at that early hour; everyone is still lost in their dreams. We’ll go to our underground spot, the little pit that is our own private world, far away from everyone else, where the silence whispers our love and the air carries the scent of romance. We’ll be completely alone, my queen, and we’ll create a memory that will live in our hearts forever. You’ll be so proud of yourself for trying, for overcoming that fear — just like the heroines in the stories we love. You’ll feel stronger and more confident than ever.

I love you more than words can say, my heartbeat. I’m certain your heart will say yes, because this love won’t fade away — it will only pull us closer. Until you’re ready, I won’t pressure you at all. But I know deep inside you already understand that this is what will bring us even closer, and that you’ll choose to live it because our love is stronger than any hesitation. It will turn that fear into endless happiness — because it will change the way you see life and the way you see us together, just like it did for so many others who started with one small brave step and ended up with a far more beautiful life.

Reply to me, my beautiful one. Let me know you’re ready to live this dream together. You are my everything. and i really want to do with you this special moment that will stay in our hearts forever.
I love you imene
